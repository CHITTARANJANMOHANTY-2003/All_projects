# Handwritten Digit Identification using TensorFlow

## 📋 Overview
This project focuses on building a machine learning model to identify handwritten digits (0-9) using the TensorFlow framework. The model is trained and evaluated using the MNIST dataset, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits. The goal is to achieve high accuracy in predicting the correct digit.

## 🚀 Features
- Preprocessing of the MNIST dataset.
- Implementation of a neural network model using TensorFlow.
- Training and validation of the model with loss and accuracy tracking.
- Visualization of training progress (loss/accuracy curves).
- Testing the model on unseen data.
- Deployment-ready for digit recognition tasks.

## 📁 Dataset
- **Name**: MNIST Dataset
- **Description**: The MNIST dataset contains 70,000 labeled images of handwritten digits (60,000 for training and 10,000 for testing). Each image is 28x28 pixels and is labeled with the corresponding digit (0-9).
- **Source**: The dataset is available in TensorFlow's `keras.datasets`.
